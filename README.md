My solution for [AoC 2021](ventofcode.com/2021/) written in separate
language for each problem.

Inspired by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding)'s approach in 2020's AoC.

Each would contain
1. source code in single file for each program,
2. input and sample input
3. Simple makefile for building.
