My solution for [AoC 2021](ventofcode.com/2021/) written in separate
language for each problem.

Inspired by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding)'s approach in 2020's [AoC](https://github.com/tsoding/aoc-2020).

Each directory would contain
1. source code in single file for each program for that day,
2. input and sample input
3. Simple makefile for building.
